Change the button text of a free download

== Description ==

This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads"). 

It adds a new option under Downloads &rarr; Settings &rarr; Misc where you can change the text that is shown for free downloads. The default is "Free - Purchase" which is not always ideal.
